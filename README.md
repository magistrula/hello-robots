## Hello Robots

### Purpose
This is an instructional app whose purpose is to demonstrate how one might lay the foundation for the desired functionality then iterate on the design & the approach.

### Project Structure
- There are 5 branches in this repository, each of which adds a little something to the app:
  - **01-buttons:** adds code to make the Charge, Dance, & Panic buttons work.
  - **02-styling:** adds css styling to page.
  - **03-colors:** replaces "red," "green," etc. with hex codes for more attractive colors, and associates different background colors with different dance messages.
  - **04-change-robots:** changes the robot image when the robot image container is clicked
  - **05-server-robots:** fetches a list of robot images from the server rather than using a hard-coded array of filenames.

### How to Run the App
1. From the root directory of the project, type `node server.js` to start the server.
2. In your web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Remember to stop the server when you're done.
